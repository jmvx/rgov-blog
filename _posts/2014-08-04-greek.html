<p>There are many options in the App Store if you search for apps that teach you the French language. The quality and the depth of instruction varies across each app. Below is a list of 5 iPhone apps (yes, only 5) that I personally recommend after filtering through the many language apps I downloaded from the app store. I looked for cheap/free, easy-to-use apps with minimal to zero in-app purchases. The apps are not listed below in any particular order. Just know that if you have these 5 apps, you have a pretty good collection to get you started (or to enrich) your french language learning experience.</p>

<h1><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/duolingo-learn-languages-for/id570060128?mt=8">Duolingo</a> ~ Learn Languages for Free</h1>

<p>Duolingo is the best and most versatile app for learning the conventions of the French language. And even better, it's free! It has also undergone many developments since I started using it including a redesign, some additional languages, more game-like competition, and streamlined transitions from lesson to lesson.</p>

<p>Throughout the regular lessons, you are exposed to a wide variety of types of questions including multiple choice, matching, and short answer. You may need to read a statement in english and type it in French, or vice versa, thus practicing your reading comprehension. You may need to listen to a statement in French, and then type it either French or English, practicing your listening comprehension skills. You are also given the opportunity to practice your skills by translating online texts or "competing" in a lesson against other Duolingo learners (or a Duobot if you prefer). It monitors your progress and tells you when you have mastered a level. It also warns you when you haven't practiced a skill recently and suggests that you "keep the owl happy" by reviewing those skill periodically.</p>

<h1><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/wordreference-dictionary/id515127233?mt=8">WordReference Dictionary</a></h1>

<p>WordReference.com is a well known dictionary website and it is also has a very thorough dictionary app. If you see a sign that says "Attention! Glissant Surface!" search "glissant" in the app and it will tell you that it's an adjective that means "slippery". Switch to the "Collins" tab and you get additional information such as other example uses of the word.</p>

<h1><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/french-verb-conjugator-conjugation/id536600573?mt=8">French Verb Conjugator</a></h1>

<p>A well known French conjugation and grammar book is the Bescherelle. There is also an iPad app, but no iPhone app that I've found (at least not in the US App Store). However, even if there was, it is a very hefty reference that is useful for someone who knows what they're looking for. (It has a lot of additional information that you may or may not need. And you may not know what to search in order to find it.) The French Verb Conjugator is a much more streamlined app that does 1 thing. It conjugates verbs in all of tenses. It also has a nice feature where it highlights the part of the conjugation that changes to help you see patterns in the conjugation. And, on its homepage, it has the most common verbs (starting with ÃŠtre and Avoir) for easy access.</p>

<h1><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/hot-radio-france/id430164002?mt=8">Hot Radio France</a></h1>

<p>French language instruction wouldn't be complete without listening comprehension. Hot Radio France gives you a huge database of streaming podcasts, music, and news stations in French. Some of my favorite stations you may want to check out are RFI Monde, RTL, and Radio BFM.</p>

<h1><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/sayhi-translate/id437818260?mt=8">SayHi Translate</a></h1>

<p>Finally, sometimes looking up definitions and verb conjugations takes too long, especially if you're in the middle of a conversation. Maybe you have a train to catch and the stress has resulted in you forgetting how to formulate a basic question in French. The SayHi Translate has all of the elements of Google Translate, plus, it reads the output to you. Speak an english sentence (or even just a word) into the app, and it tells you what the French equivalent is. And, it reads it to you, so you have an idea of how to repeat it to someone else.</p>
