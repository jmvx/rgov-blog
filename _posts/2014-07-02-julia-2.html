<p>I am 25 years old and I just got my drivers license. I did not grow up in the city. I lived in upstate New York, which was pretty boring without a car. I am just very good at carpools and I'm very patient with public transportation.</p>

<p>It's not like I never <i>tried</i> to learn how to drive. I took drivers ed in high school and was very excited to get my permit for the first time. It then occurred to me while I was practicing for the road test, that I really hated driving. I didn't like the feeling that I was expected to control a 4,000 pound piece of machinery as I barreled down the road at 40 mph. I didn't like not being able to tell where the car was in relation to the lines on the road or the cars driving beside me. Parking was terrifying. Turning was terrifying. Before I knew it, I left for RPI and still hadn't taken the road test.</p>

<p>And that was OK. I didn't need to drive at RPI. Troy had everything I needed within walking distance. The only thing I couldn't really do easily was grocery shopping, but I ended up just carpooling with other students to the nearby Price Chopper.</p>

<p>Eventually, I left for graduate school. And, once again, I didn't need to drive. I lucked out since Stanford had a shuttle system called the Marguerite which took me wherever I needed to go. I could even take the shuttles to the school I student taught at.</p>

<p>After I graduate Stanford, I got a job teaching in South San Jose and I lived downtown. So, once again, I lucked out since downtown San Jose has a light rail system that I can take to work. I can also take light rail to Kaiser for my doctor's visits. I continued doing this for two years and it was fantastic, except for one thing...</p>

<p>I love to dance, and the one thing that was very difficult to do without a car was going to dance lessons. I often work late hours at school and the time it takes to walk to the light rail station, take light rail home, and transfer to a bus to go to the dance lesson, was too much.</p>

<h1>Lessons</h1>
<p>It took me one month to learn how to drive. I piled on private lessons from two different driving schools and practiced driving Ryan to work in his new Chevy Volt. I drove Ryan to Apple almost every day for two weeks and spent my days sitting in lobbies listening to audio books and Coursera lectures since I wasn't allowed to drive home after dropping him off.</p>

<h1>Road Test</h1>
<p>I took the road test at the Santa Clara DMV. A few people recommended the Santa Clara DMV since the roads were a bit wider than downtown. We showed up before the DMV opened, and there was already a line stretching around the entire building. Long story short, I took the road test and passed with only five errors. Watch out California. I'm now officially licensed to drive.</p>
